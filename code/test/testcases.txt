A list of good test cases for the assignment:

Ingestion:
- Test whether the parallel download method is faster than the singular method for batch download.
- Test that each batch download method actually downloads the data in correct batches.
- Test that all files are downloaded correctly by comparing the downloaded files (size, name, data etc.) towards files
  and the archived batch tree.
- Test whether an increase in threads will increase the download speed for parallel download method.

Transformation:
- Test whether files are merged correctly:
    - Test whether two files are appended correctly wrt. rows and columns.
    - Test all requirements to columns and data in the merged file.
- Test further for single utility functions.
